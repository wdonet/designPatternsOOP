# Proxy Pattern (Structural)
>Allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping its own interface around that of an already existing class

## Problem 
- You want/need to instantiate some object until it is required by the first time
- You have an object capable to do something but you need to add some validations before call it
- There exists a remote system capable to do something and you need to call it
- You need to add additional actions before or after calling an existing method of any class

## Solution
Creates a class that wraps the main object where you can add any validations or actions before or after 
delegating the call to the desired object.

## Considerations
- Proxy and Subject must be interchangeable
- Consider defining a Factory that can encapsulate the decision of whether a proxy or original object is desirable.

## Related patterns
- Adapter provides a different interface to its subject. Proxy provides the same interface. Decorator provides an enhanced interface.
